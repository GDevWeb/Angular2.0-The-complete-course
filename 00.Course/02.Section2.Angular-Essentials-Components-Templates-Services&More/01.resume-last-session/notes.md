### **Session Summary**

#### **Chapters Covered:**

1. **Configuring Components**:

   - Used `@Input()` to pass data dynamically from parent to child components.
   - Added a subtitle and background color to the `HeaderComponent`.

2. **Using Components**:

   - Integrated custom components like `HeaderComponent` and `SidebarComponent` into the app layout.
   - Passed data dynamically to components for reuse.

3. **Component Communication**:

   - Explored `@Input()` for parent-to-child communication.
   - Utilized `@Output()` with `EventEmitter` for child-to-parent communication.
   - Introduced services (`BehaviorSubject`) for sibling communication.

4. **Advanced Directives**:
   - Learned about structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) to control DOM rendering.
   - Applied attribute directives (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`) for dynamic styling.
   - Created a custom directive (`appHighlight`) to add hover effects.

#### **Key Achievements:**

- Resolved a critical error involving `*ngFor` by importing `CommonModule`.
- Practiced implementing reusable components with dynamic inputs and outputs.
- Successfully built and tested a custom directive to enhance DOM interactivity.

#### **Next Steps:**

- Continue exploring advanced Angular features, focusing on interactivity and modularity.
- Build upon concepts like custom directives and services for larger application needs.
