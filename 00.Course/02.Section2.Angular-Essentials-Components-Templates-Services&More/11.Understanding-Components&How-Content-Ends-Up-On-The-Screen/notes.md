- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/43788460#overview)

- **Purpose**: Learn the role of components in Angular and how they render content on the screen.

- **What Are Components?**:

  - **Definition**: Components are the building blocks of an Angular application.
  - **Structure**: Each component has three main parts:
    1. **HTML Template**: Defines the layout and structure of the UI.
    2. **TypeScript Class**: Contains logic and data for the component.
    3. **CSS/SCSS File**: Adds styling specific to the component.

- **How Content is Rendered**:

  1. **Root Component**: Angular applications start with a root component (usually `app.component`).
  2. **Templates**: The root component template includes other components and HTML elements.
  3. **Rendering Process**: Angular combines the logic, data, and template to display the content dynamically.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Components control specific parts of the UI.
  - Each component is reusable and independent, promoting modular development.
  - Angular uses a **tree structure** of components, starting from the root.
