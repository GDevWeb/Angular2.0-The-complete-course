### **Objective of the Module**:

To gain a strong understanding of Angular's core features, including:

- Project structure and setup.
- Component creation and communication.
- Data binding and event handling.
- Rendering and updating dynamic UI content.

#### **Key Concepts**:

1. **Understanding Angular Project Structure**:

   - Learn how Angular organizes its files and folders.
   - Understand key files such as `app.module.ts`, `main.ts`, and `angular.json`.
   - Explore the role of components, templates, and styles in Angular projects.

2. **Working with Components**:

   - Learn to create reusable and configurable components.
   - Understand how components are the building blocks of Angular applications.

3. **Handling User Events**:

   - Discover how Angular manages user interactions using event binding.
   - Learn to capture and respond to events dynamically.

4. **Rendering and Updating Dynamic UI Content**:
   - Utilize Angular’s data-binding features to dynamically update the UI.
   - Leverage conditional rendering and loops to display data effectively.

#### **Modern Angular Practices**:

- Focus on **signals** for reactive programming (when introduced).
- Use TypeScript features such as type aliases and interfaces for robust code.
- Avoid legacy practices unless necessary for comparison.

#### **End Goals**:

By the end of this module, you will:

- Be familiar with Angular’s project structure and component-based architecture.
- Know how to build dynamic, responsive user interfaces using Angular.
- Have the foundation to start building the EasyTask project.

#### **Link to the EasyTask Project**:

- The EasyTask project will serve as a practical implementation of all the concepts covered in this module.
- Key deliverables for the project:
  1. Setting up a well-organized Angular project.
  2. Creating dynamic user interfaces using components.
  3. Implementing data-binding and event handling.

**Next Step**:

- Start with setting up the Angular project and analyzing the project structure as covered in the next section.
