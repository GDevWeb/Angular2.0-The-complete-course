### Why using Angular?

1. Simplifies the process of building complex, interactive web user interfaces

   1. write declarative code
   2. separation of the responsibilities and concerns
   3. Build a component once and re-use it often as needed

2. Better Development process
   1. assign different team members to different components
   2. share components & logic across the team
   3. reduce dependencies

## What you need ?

Just know javascript because along this course we will (re)view OOP and typescript that are master pieces of Angular
